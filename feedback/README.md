This folder contains the Google Apps Script that feeds feedback responses
through a Google Form and stores them in its linked spreadsheet, along with the
anonymized client data at the time of the response. It is managed locally and
kept up-to-date with the Google Drive cloud using
[clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp); see the clasp documentation for
usage instructions.
