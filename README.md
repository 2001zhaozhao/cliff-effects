# cliff-effects

> **cliff effect**: You are a person on government benefits, and you get a raise.  You're making more money!  But now that your income is higher, you don't make the cutoff for the benefits you receive.  Even though you're taking home more money, your situation is worse. Some of your benefits drop to nothing, or almost nothing. You've fallen off "the cliff."

We are building the Cliff Effects webapp to help [Project Hope](http://www.prohope.org/) case workers make quantifiable predictions about their clients' potential cliff effects.

(LOL what is our theory of change.)

## Installation and Setup for Local Development

1. If you don't already have Node.js, [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.11.1 is verified as compatible).  To check if Node is already installed, type `node --version` into terminal.
2. Open the node command prompt and change into the directory that you want to clone the app to.
3. Clone the repo to your local machine with `git clone https://github.com/adanaher/cliff-effects.git`.
4. Change into the new repository's directory with `cd cliff-effects`.
5. Change to the master branch with `git checkout master`.
6. Install all necessary node packages with `npm install`. This might take a few minutes.
7. Type `npm start` to automatically open a browser window and run the app in your browser in dev mode. If you make changes to a file and save it, the page will automatically update and use the new code. I would also recommend getting the [React Developer Tools](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiZ__6Vg_jVAhWQ14MKHczrDtoQFgg4MAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Freact-developer-tools%2Ffmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi%3Fhl%3Den&usg=AFQjCNEv0udXgBoaukzJa59I_vufhScUbQ) extension for Chrome.
8. `Ctrl-C` to stop the app when it's running.
9. Type `npm run build` to build a production version of the app.

Note that I also have it set up to deploy automatically to github pages with the command `npm run deploy`.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
